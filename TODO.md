## TODOs
- [ ] Number of features
- [ ] CFBD Advanced Stats
- [ ] Basic analysis on predicted edge (which allows)
    - [ ] Isotonic regression, useful for when I'm conditioning on my predicted spread
- [ ] Train metrics?

## Shelved for later
- [ ] Obtain basic historical market data with payouts
    - Frankly, -110 us a pretty safe estimate
- [ ] Obtain market data for derivative lines  
- [ ] Obtain weather data
- [ ] Obtain CLV, another simple metric for whether or not my preds are any good
- [ ] Some model stacking + representation learning 

## Ideas
- "Explosiveness"
- Smarter elo system
- Minimizing logloss by experimenting with Classification rather than Regression
- When breaking down into specific feature classes, we can see which direction aligns (i.e. offense + and spread +)
